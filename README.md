# üìë Simple Wildcards Collection for Stable Diffusion

This is my collection of useful [Wildcards](https://github.com/adieyal/sd-dynamic-prompts/blob/main/docs/SYNTAX.md#wildcards). I created most of them using [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) and [Claude](https://claude.ai/) to streamline my work with [Stable Diffusion](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) and avoid using the [Dynamic Prompts](https://github.com/adieyal/sd-dynamic-prompts/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#basic-usage), which I used before. Through my experience, I've found that Wildcards are more convenient to use.

The purpose of these Wildcards is to introduce randomness and diversity into the created graphics. They are mainly intended to help you in creating scenes with people.

Since I work with these Wildcards myself, I catch problematic prompts and remove them. Sometimes I also add new prompts, and even entire files.

# üíª Preparations

To use these Wildcards, you need an extension. You can use one of the following:

- [sd-dynamic-prompts](https://github.com/adieyal/sd-dynamic-prompts)
- [stable-diffusion-webui-wildcards](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui-wildcards)

Most likely, after installing the extension, you'll need to restart Stable Diffusion (or the [rented server instance](https://cloud.vast.ai/?ref_id=62878&creator_id=42512&name=null)) for the extension to work correctly. A simple reload of WebUI may not be sufficient. If you installed the extension using the [Provisioning Script](https://github.com/ai-dock/stable-diffusion-webui/blob/main/config/provisioning/default.sh) from [AI-Dock](https://github.com/ai-dock/stable-diffusion-webui), a restart will not be necessary.

# üíæ Installation

Once you have a working Wildcards extension, you need wildcard `.txt` files in appropriate directory. In the case of the two mentioned plugins, it will be the `wildcards` directory in the main directory of the extension.

The path to the directory may look like this:  
`stable-diffusion-webui/extensions/sd-dynamic-prompts/wildcards/`  
`stable-diffusion-webui/extensions/stable-diffusion-webui-wildcards/wildcards/`

Enter **the proper directory** and download the files from this repository. You can do this in several ways:
## Download with [CURL](https://curl.se/) and [XARGS](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/xargs.1.html)

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Avaray/stable-diffusion-simple-wildcards/main/files | xargs -n 1 -P 8 curl -s -fLO --retry 3 --remote-name-all
```

## Download with [WGET](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/) and [unzip](https://linux.die.net/man/1/unzip)

```bash
wget -q https://github.com/Avaray/stable-diffusion-simple-wildcards/archive/refs/heads/main.zip -O main.zip &&
unzip -joq main.zip '*.txt' &&
rm -f main.zip
```

## Download with [GIT](https://git-scm.com/)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Avaray/stable-diffusion-simple-wildcards/ &&
mv stable-diffusion-simple-wildcards/*.txt ../ &&
rm -rf stable-diffusion-simple-wildcards
```

### How to download Wildcards ???

- You can manually download these files as a [compressed archive](https://github.com/Avaray/stable-diffusion-simple-wildcards/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and extract them by yourself.
- You can download them using [git-clone](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone) (output directory must be empty).

### Optional settings

If you are using `sd-dynamic-prompts`, you can enable one useful option in the extension settings.  
`Settings` -> `Uncategorised` -> `Dynamic Prompts` -> `Save template to metadata: Write prompt template into the PNG metadata`

# ‚ö°Ô∏è Usage

Let's say you want to generate a scene with a woman in a random location. Let her clothing be random as well.  
`photography of __nationalities__ woman BREAK wearing __colors__ __clothes_upper__ BREAK in __locations__`

The initial prompt will look as follows:  
`photography of Polish woman BREAK wearing purple jacket BREAK in city street`

With `sd-dynamic-prompts`, you can also use [Variables](https://github.com/adieyal/sd-dynamic-prompts/blob/main/docs/SYNTAX.md#variables)

`${c=__colors__} woman in __locations__ BREAK ${c} shirt BREAK ${c} skirt BREAK ${c} boots`

The prompt will look like this:  
`woman in park BREAK pink shirt BREAK pink skirt BREAK pink boots`

You can read more about BREAK keyword [in this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/15bty86/prompt_trick_for_more_consistent_results_in/).

**WARNING**: [Nationalities](https://github.com/Avaray/stable-diffusion-simple-wildcards/blob/main/nationalities.txt) does not work well with `Pony Diffusion` checkpoints. You need to use it with good checkpoints focused on real people. I recommend using one of following checkpoints:

- [WildCardX-XL](https://civitai.com/models/239561/wildcardx-xl) `SDXL 1.0`
- [ZavyChromaXL](https://civitai.com/models/119229/zavychromaxl) `SDXL 1.0`
- [\_CHINOOK\_](https://civitai.com/models/400589/chinook) `SDXL 1.0`
- [epiCRealism XL](https://civitai.com/models/277058/epicrealism-xl) `SDXL 1.0`
