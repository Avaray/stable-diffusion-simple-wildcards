# üìë Wildcards for Stable Diffusion WebUI

I created these Wildcards using [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) to streamline my work with [Stable Diffusion](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) and avoid using the [Dynamic Prompts](https://github.com/adieyal/sd-dynamic-prompts) extension, which I used before. Through my experience, I've found that Wildcards work better.

The purpose of these Wildcards is to introduce randomness and diversity into the created graphics. They are mainly intended to help you in creating scenes with people.

# ‚ö°Ô∏è Usage
To use these Wildcards, you need an extension. You can use the official one [stable-diffusion-webui-wildcards](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui-wildcards). Of course, there are other extensions that allow you to use Wildcards. I recommend the one I mentioned because it's the simplest.

Most likely, after installing the extension, you'll need to restart Stable Diffusion (or the rented server) for the extension to work correctly. A simple reload of WebUI may not be sufficient.
