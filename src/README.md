# üìë Wildcards Collection for Stable Diffusion

<!-- TESTING IF ANIMATED WEBP WORKS IN GITHUB -->

![Nationalities](images/nationalities_animated.webp)

**Wildcards** in this collection are mainly created for realistic scenes with people. Hoever, they can be used for other types of art as well. They will give you inspiration and boost your creativity.

Since I work with these Wildcards myself, I catch problematic keywords and remove them. Sometimes I also add new keywords, and even entire files. I'm constantly looking for new ideas to expand this collection.

The main idea is to not overcomplicate things. Dealing with thousands of weirdly named wildcards may be overwhelming. I believe it's better to have a few that you **can remember** and **use effectively**.

# üíª Preparations

To use these Wildcards, you need an extension. You can use one of the following:

- [sd-dynamic-prompts](https://github.com/adieyal/sd-dynamic-prompts) `Recommended`
- [stable-diffusion-webui-wildcards](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui-wildcards)

### Check if the extension works

Most likely, after installing the extension, you'll need to restart Stable Diffusion (or the [rented server instance](https://cloud.vast.ai/?ref_id=62878&creator_id=42512&name=null)) for the extension to work correctly. **A simple reload of WebUI may not be sufficient**. You can easily check if the extension works by generating an image. If the keyword `colors` appears where you used `__colors__` wildcard, it means something is wrong.

If you installed the extension using the [Provisioning Script](https://github.com/ai-dock/stable-diffusion-webui/blob/main/config/provisioning/default.sh) from [AI-Dock](https://github.com/ai-dock/stable-diffusion-webui), a restart will not be necessary üëå

### Useful optional steps

If you decided to use [sd-dynamic-prompts](https://github.com/adieyal/sd-dynamic-prompts), I recommend you to enable one useful option in the extension settings.  
`Settings > Uncategorised > Dynamic Prompts > Save template to metadata: Write prompt template into the PNG `

# üíæ Installation

Once you have a working Wildcards extension, you need wildcard `.txt` files in appropriate directory. In the case of the two mentioned plugins, it will be the `wildcards` directory in the main directory of the extension.

The path to the directory may look like this:  
`stable-diffusion-webui/extensions/sd-dynamic-prompts/wildcards/`  
`stable-diffusion-webui/extensions/stable-diffusion-webui-wildcards/wildcards/`

Navigate to **the proper directory** and download the files.  
You can download them with the following command:

# ‚ö°Ô∏è Usage

A **Wildcard** is essentially a name of a file that contains a list of keywords. If you have a file named `colors.txt`, you can use the wildcard in your prompt as `__colors__`. Stable Diffusion will replace `__colors__` with a random keyword from the `colors.txt` file.

Let's say you want to generate a scene with a woman in a random location. Let her clothing be random as well.

> photography of **\_\_nationalities\_\_** woman, wearing **\_\_colors\_\_** **\_\_clothes_upper\_\_**, standing in **\_\_locations\_\_**

The initial prompt will look like this:

> photography of **Spanish** woman, wearing **black dress**, standing in **restaurant**

You can also use [Variables](https://github.com/adieyal/sd-dynamic-prompts/blob/main/docs/SYNTAX.md#variables)  
`sd-dynamic-prompts only`

> **\${c=\_\_colors\_\_}** woman in **\_\_locations\_\_**, **\${c}** shirt, **\${c}** skirt, **\${c}** boots

The prompt will look like this:

> woman in **dressing room**, **pink** shirt, **pink** skirt, **pink** boots

To get [multiple values](https://github.com/adieyal/sd-dynamic-prompts/blob/main/docs/SYNTAX.md#choosing-multiple-values) from one wildcard, you can specify amount of values you want to get.  
`sd-dynamic-prompts only`

> photography of toy cars, **{4$$\_\_colors\_\_}**

The prompt will look like this:

> photography of toy cars, **red**, **blue**, **green**, **yellow**

### WARNING

Checkpoints that are based on `Pony Diffusion` may not work with some of these Wildcards. `Pony Diffusion` checkpoints were trained on completely different data and lack the knowledge about many things. `Nationalities`, `Artists`, `Cameras` and `Films` most likely will not work at all. If you are planning to use these Wildcards for generating realistic scenes, you should use good checkpoints focused on real people. I recommend using one of following checkpoints:

- [WildCardX-XL](https://civitai.com/models/239561/wildcardx-xl) `SDXL 1.0`
- [ZavyChromaXL](https://civitai.com/models/119229/zavychromaxl) `SDXL 1.0`
- [\_CHINOOK\_](https://civitai.com/models/400589/chinook) `SDXL 1.0`
- [epiCRealism XL](https://civitai.com/models/277058/epicrealism-xl) `SDXL 1.0`

For `Nationalities` it's good to be around `CFG Scale 6-7` to see how prompt affect the generated person (you can read more about it [here](https://dav.one/using-prompts-to-modify-face-and-body-in-stable-diffusion)). For `Artists` it's better to have `CFG Scale 2-5` to achieve best results. In both cases Checkpoint will have the biggest impact on the final result. Every checkpoint is different.
