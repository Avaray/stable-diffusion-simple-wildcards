# üñ•Ô∏è Terminal commands

The following commands are intended for [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux). If you want to use them on [Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows), I recommend using [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal) along with [BASH](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/), which is automatically installed with [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
